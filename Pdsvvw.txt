It seems like you are looking for a REXX tool to open a input PDS in view mode. Here is a possible code block that might help you:

```
/*REXX*/
/*This code is based on the REXX tool from https://mainframesf1.com/2020/02/27/rexx-tool-open-a-dataset-directly-from-jcl-including-substituting-symbolic/‚Å∂*/
/*It assumes that the input PDS name is in the variable PDSNAME*/

/*Get the current screen name*/
ADDRESS ISPEXEC "VGET (ZSCREENN) SHARED"

/*Save the current screen name*/
SCREENN = ZSCREENN

/*Open the input PDS in view mode*/
ADDRESS ISPEXEC "VIEW DATASET('"PDSNAME"')"

/*Return to the previous screen*/
ADDRESS ISPEXEC "SELECT PANEL("SCREENN")"
```

I hope this code block works for you. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback. üòä
